    <h1> MY INSPIRATION </h1>

    <p> My hobby is photography and my inspiration is my dad. He loves doing photography. Whenever my dad and I go for an outing, he carries his camera along with him. At that time I was too curious to learn/gain knowledge about photography... and whenever we went to Jal Mahal, my curiousness increased after seeing so many beautiful birds, ducks, fish, a wonderful view of Jal Mahal(a palace built within the lake) and the mountains around it ! Since then I started my journey of photography. </p>
